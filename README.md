# VortexPanelMethod
A numerical analysis project for predicting the lifting flow over several NACA airfoils. Software developed with Matlab, involves basic algorithm implementation

## Running the Code:
* Download all Matlab Files
* Open in Matlab software (2014b or newer)
* Run the "runThis.m" file
* All calculations will appear on the screen

## Changing the Code for Other Resolutions
* Go to line 11 on "runThis.m" and change N to your desired number (Note: That N=250 panels is the nominal case)

## Change the Code for Other Airfoil Shapes or Freestream Conditions
* Go to line 12 to change freestream Velocity
* Go to line 13 to change angle of attack
* Go to lines 17, 18, 19 to change airfoil geometry
